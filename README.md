## üìñ Introduction

The **Network File System (NFS)** is a protocol that allows files to be accessed and shared across multiple systems over a network as if they were local files. This project provides a comprehensive guide for configuring an NFS server and client, focusing on file synchronization, secure sharing, and scalability. The setup aims to demonstrate NFS concepts, enabling users to explore real-world networking challenges and solutions.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Server Configuration**:
  - Share directories with customizable permissions.
  - Support for read-only or read-write access for clients.
  - Compatibility with both local and remote clients.

- **Client Access**:
  - Seamless mounting of shared directories.
  - Efficient synchronization between server and client.

- **Planned GUI Integration**:
  - A graphical interface using **Tinker** for easier NFS management, including configuring shared directories and monitoring activity.

- **Logging and Monitoring**:
  - Maintain detailed logs for shared file access to assist with troubleshooting and system auditing.

---

## üõ† System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 or higher, or any compatible Linux distribution.
- **Required Tools**:
  - `nfs-kernel-server` for the server-side configuration.
  - `nfs-common` for the client-side operations.
- **Networking**:
  - Server and client need network connectivity, either local or remote.
- **Testing Environment**:
  - Setup verified using **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Server Setup

1. **Install NFS Kernel Server**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
   ```

2. **Define Shared Directories**: Edit the `/etc/exports` file to specify the directories that will be shared:

   ```bash
   /exports/backup 127.0.0.1(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
   /exports/docs 127.0.0.1(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
   /exports/testfolder 127.0.0.1(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
   ```

3. **Export Configurations**:

   ```bash
   sudo exportfs -a
   ```

4. **Start and Enable NFS Service**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start nfs-kernel-server
   sudo systemctl enable nfs-kernel-server
   ```

### Client Setup

1. **Install NFS Utilities**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nfs-common
   ```

2. **Mount the NFS Shares**:

   ```bash
   sudo mount -t nfs <server-ip>:/exports/backup /mnt/nfs/backup
   sudo mount -t nfs <server-ip>:/exports/docs /mnt/nfs/docs
   sudo mount -t nfs <server-ip>:/exports/testfolder /mnt/nfs/testfolder
   ```

---

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Start the NFS Server**: Ensure that the server is running:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start nfs-kernel-server
   ```

2. **Access Shared Files**: On the client, navigate to the mounted directories to access the shared files:

   ```bash
   cd /mnt/nfs/backup
   ```

3. **View Mounted Directories**:

   ```bash
   showmount -e <server-ip>
   ```

4. **Unmount Directories**: Once finished, unmount the directories:

   ```bash
   sudo umount /mnt/nfs/backup
   sudo umount /mnt/nfs/docs
   sudo umount /mnt/nfs/testfolder
   ```

5. **Logs and Troubleshooting**:
   - **Verify Exported Shares**:

     ```bash
     sudo exportfs
     ```

   - **Check Logs in `/var/log/syslog` for Debugging**:

     ```bash
     sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
     grep nfs /var/log/syslog
     ```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### 1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Integration**
   - **Objective**: Develop a GUI for easier management of the NFS server and client configurations using **Tinker**. This will allow users to:
     - Manage shared directories.
     - Start/stop the NFS service.
     - View logs and troubleshoot in real-time.
   - **Benefit**: Simplifies the NFS management process, making it user-friendly for non-technical users.

### 2. **Support for Multiple Clients**
   - **Objective**: Improve the server to handle multiple clients with various access levels (e.g., read-only for some clients, read-write for others).
   - **Benefit**: Makes the NFS system scalable and adaptable to more complex network environments.

### 3. **Automated Backup and Synchronization**
   - **Objective**: Implement scripts that automatically back up shared directories and synchronize data between server and clients.
   - **Benefit**: Ensures data is consistently backed up, preventing data loss.

### 4. **Security Enhancements**
   - **Objective**: Add **Kerberos authentication** to ensure secure communication between server and client, along with additional firewall and encryption measures.
   - **Benefit**: Increases the security of the NFS system by protecting data and verifying identities.

### 5. **Cloud Integration**
   - **Objective**: Integrate cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for off-site backups.
   - **Benefit**: Adds redundancy and ensures data protection in case of hardware failure.

## üß© Challenges Faced

- **Compatibility Issues with WSL**: One of the major challenges was ensuring that the NFS server and client configuration worked smoothly within **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**. NFS is primarily designed for Linux, so some tweaks and workarounds were required to get it to function correctly in a WSL environment.
- **File Permissions and Access Control**: Configuring granular file permissions and ensuring that clients could only access the appropriate directories was tricky. It involved editing the `/etc/exports` file multiple times to get the correct permissions.
- **Performance Issues**: There were some performance-related challenges when accessing files over the network. This was mainly related to the size and number of files being shared and required optimization for smooth synchronization between the server and clients.
