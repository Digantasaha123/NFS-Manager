NFS Setup Guide
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the Network File System (NFS) server and client, ensuring proper configuration and functionality.

Prerequisites
Linux-based system (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 or higher)
Network connectivity between server and client
Basic understanding of Linux commands

Required packages:
nfs-kernel-server (server)
nfs-common (client)


1. Server Setup
Step 1: Install NFS Kernel Server
Run the following commands on the server machine to install the required packages:


sudo apt update
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server

Step 2: Create Directories to Share
Decide which directories you want to share over the network. For example:


sudo mkdir -p /exports/backup
sudo mkdir -p /exports/docs
sudo mkdir -p /exports/testfolder


Set appropriate permissions:

sudo chmod 777 /exports/backup
sudo chmod 755 /exports/docs
sudo chmod 777 /exports/testfolder

Step 3: Configure Exported Directories
Edit the NFS exports file:

sudo nano /etc/exports

Add the following entries:

/exports/backup 127.0.0.1(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/exports/docs 127.0.0.1(ro,sync)
/exports/testfolder 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync)

Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

Step 4: Apply Export Configurations
Run the following command to apply the export configurations:

sudo exportfs -a

Step 5: Start and Enable NFS Service
Start the NFS server:

sudo systemctl start nfs-kernel-server

Enable the service to start at boot:

sudo systemctl enable nfs-kernel-server


2. Client Setup

Step 1: Install NFS Utilities
Run the following commands on the client machine to install required packages:


sudo apt update
sudo apt install nfs-common

Step 2: Mount Shared Directories
Create local directories to mount the shared NFS directories:

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs/backup
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs/docs
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs/testfolder

Mount the NFS shares:

sudo mount -t nfs <SERVER_IP>:/exports/backup /mnt/nfs/backup
sudo mount -t nfs <SERVER_IP>:/exports/docs /mnt/nfs/docs
sudo mount -t nfs <SERVER_IP>:/exports/testfolder /mnt/nfs/testfolder

Step 3: Verify Mounts
List the mounted NFS directories:

df -h | grep nfs

3. Testing and Usage
Verify Exports
On the server, check exported directories:

sudo exportfs

Access Shared Files
On the client, navigate to the mounted directories:

cd /mnt/nfs/backup
ls

Unmount Directories
When done, unmount the directories on the client:

sudo umount /mnt/nfs/backup
sudo umount /mnt/nfs/docs
sudo umount /mnt/nfs/testfolder

4. Logs and Troubleshooting
View Server Logs
Check logs on the server for NFS activity:

sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog

Filter NFS-specific logs:

grep nfs /var/log/syslog

Check Export Status
Ensure exports are configured correctly:

sudo showmount -e <SERVER_IP>

Restart NFS Service
If issues persist, restart the NFS server:

sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server

5.
Launch the Tinker-based GUI :
for server :

python3 home/nfs_export_manager.py

for Client:

 python3 home/digantta/nfs_manager.py

Use the GUI to configure exports, monitor activity, and manage shares.

6. Notes
Replace <SERVER_IP> with your server's IP address.
Ensure proper firewall settings to allow NFS traffic (ports 2049 and 111).
Backup the /etc/exports file before making changes.
