NFS Setup Guide
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the Network File System (NFS) server and client, ensuring proper configuration and functionality.

Prerequisites
Linux-based system (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 or higher)
Network connectivity between server and client
Basic understanding of Linux commands
Required packages:
nfs-kernel-server (server)
nfs-common (client)
1. Server Setup
Step 1: Install NFS Kernel Server
Run the following commands on the server machine to install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
Step 2: Create Directories to Share
Decide which directories you want to share over the network. For example:

bash
Copy code
sudo mkdir -p /exports/backup
sudo mkdir -p /exports/docs
sudo mkdir -p /exports/testfolder
Set appropriate permissions:

bash
Copy code
sudo chmod 777 /exports/backup
sudo chmod 755 /exports/docs
sudo chmod 777 /exports/testfolder
Step 3: Configure Exported Directories
Edit the NFS exports file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/exports
Add the following entries:

bash
Copy code
/exports/backup 127.0.0.1(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/exports/docs 127.0.0.1(ro,sync)
/exports/testfolder 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync)
Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

Step 4: Apply Export Configurations
Run the following command to apply the export configurations:

bash
Copy code
sudo exportfs -a
Step 5: Start and Enable NFS Service
Start the NFS server:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start nfs-kernel-server
Enable the service to start at boot:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable nfs-kernel-server
2. Client Setup
Step 1: Install NFS Utilities
Run the following commands on the client machine to install required packages:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nfs-common
Step 2: Mount Shared Directories
Create local directories to mount the shared NFS directories:

bash
Copy code
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs/backup
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs/docs
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs/testfolder
Mount the NFS shares:

bash
Copy code
sudo mount -t nfs <SERVER_IP>:/exports/backup /mnt/nfs/backup
sudo mount -t nfs <SERVER_IP>:/exports/docs /mnt/nfs/docs
sudo mount -t nfs <SERVER_IP>:/exports/testfolder /mnt/nfs/testfolder
Step 3: Verify Mounts
List the mounted NFS directories:

bash
Copy code
df -h | grep nfs
3. Testing and Usage
Verify Exports
On the server, check exported directories:

bash
Copy code
sudo exportfs
Access Shared Files
On the client, navigate to the mounted directories:

bash
Copy code
cd /mnt/nfs/backup
ls
Unmount Directories
When done, unmount the directories on the client:

bash
Copy code
sudo umount /mnt/nfs/backup
sudo umount /mnt/nfs/docs
sudo umount /mnt/nfs/testfolder
4. Logs and Troubleshooting
View Server Logs
Check logs on the server for NFS activity:

bash
Copy code
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
Filter NFS-specific logs:

bash
Copy code
grep nfs /var/log/syslog
Check Export Status
Ensure exports are configured correctly:

bash
Copy code
sudo showmount -e <SERVER_IP>
Restart NFS Service
If issues persist, restart the NFS server:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
5. GUI Integration (Optional)
To manage NFS using a graphical interface:

Launch the Tinker-based GUI from your project:
bash
Copy code
python3 path/to/gui_script.py
Use the GUI to configure exports, monitor activity, and manage shares.
6. Notes
Replace <SERVER_IP> with your server's IP address.
Ensure proper firewall settings to allow NFS traffic (ports 2049 and 111).
Backup the /etc/exports file before making changes.
